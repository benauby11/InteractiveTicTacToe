# Interactive TicTacToe

## Overview
Here is an interactive console-based Tic Tac Toe game using React. It implements the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to provide an optimized and competitive game experience.

## Inspiration
It is inspired by Professor Alam's Tic Tac Toe game, as well as my own TicTacToe game coded in C++.
